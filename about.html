                        <h3>Roses</h3> 
                    </div>
                    <p>Roses are timeless flowers celebrated for their beauty, fragrance, and deep symbolism of love and devotion. Available in endless varieties and colors, they suit every emotion and occasion. To care for roses, trim their stems at a 45° angle before placing them in water, remove any leaves below the waterline to prevent bacteria growth, and refresh their water every two days. Keep them away from direct sunlight and heat to enjoy their full beauty longer.

                    </div>
                    
                    <p>Tulips are joyful signs of spring and new beginnings, charming with their clean shapes and bright colors. Surprisingly, tulips continue to grow even after being cut! To keep tulips fresh, trim their stems straight across, use cold water in the vase, and place them in a cool, shaded spot. Rotate the vase daily, as tulips naturally lean toward light sources.

                    <p>Lilies bring a majestic, dramatic touch with their bold blooms and strong fragrance, symbolizing purity and renewal. Their pollen can stain, so it's best to gently remove the stamens once the flowers open. Trim their stems, change their water every two to three days, and place them in indirect sunlight to keep them fresh and vibrant. Removing fading petals will also help lilies stay stunning longer.

                    <p>Peonies are lush, romantic flowers known for their soft layers of petals and sweet scent. With a short blooming season, they are cherished for their fleeting beauty and symbolize prosperity and romance. To care for peonies, cut their stems at an angle, place them in cool water, and avoid keeping them in overly warm rooms. Remove spent blooms as they fade to encourage the remaining ones to open fully.

                    <p>Orchids are exotic, graceful plants that symbolize strength, beauty, and luxury. Unlike most flowers, orchids naturally grow on trees, not in the ground. They prefer a special kind of care: water them once a week by soaking their roots lightly, provide bright but indirect light, and ensure they have excellent drainage. Avoid letting orchids sit in standing water to keep them healthy and blooming.

                    <p>Sunflowers are radiant symbols of happiness, vitality, and loyalty, famously following the movement of the sun. Their bold yellow faces bring joy to any space. To care for sunflowers, use a tall, strong vase to support their heavy heads, trim the stems daily, and refresh the water often. Although they love the sun outdoors, keep indoor arrangements out of direct, intense sunlight to prevent early wilting.

                    <p>Daisies are the fresh, cheerful faces of the flower world, representing innocence, purity, and simple joy. Hardy and charming, they brighten any bouquet effortlessly. To help daisies last longer, trim their stems under running water to avoid air bubbles, use lukewarm water, and change it every two days. Keep them away from ripening fruits, as ethylene gas can cause them to wilt more quickly.

                    <p>Hydrangeas charm with their full, cloud-like clusters and come in rich, beautiful shades. They symbolize heartfelt emotions, gratitude, and deep understanding. Hydrangeas are very thirsty flowers, drinking water both through their stems and their petals. Always keep their vase full of fresh water, and if they start to wilt, you can revive them by submerging their heads completely in water for about fifteen minutes. Keeping them in a cool environment will help them stay lush and beautiful.
